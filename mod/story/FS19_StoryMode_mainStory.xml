            <storyText>Hello there buddy. My name is Thomas Witherfield and I am the mayor of Felsbrunn! I heard you are interested in starting a farm here. Here is the deal: I offer you a starter loan and in exchange you are going to follow my plans. See, i have a vision in my mind of how we can make Felsbrunn so much more attractive to tourists and turn the fields around here into a beautiful scenery of growing plants of all variety and animals living in free range. Do you accept?</storyText>

            <titleText>Buy your first patch of land</titleText>
            <storyText>Hello there buddy. I am glad you accepted my proposal. So let's get started, we have so much work ahead of us. Felsbrunn will become the greatest town. I am so glad I finally found someone willing to put in all the work. Let us start of by buying a patch of land to build you a farmhouse on. I would suggest field number 20, it has a lot of space for buildings and is not to expensive.</storyText>
