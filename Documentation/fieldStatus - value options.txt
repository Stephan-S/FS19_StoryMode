Example trigger:
    <trigger_1 triggerType="fieldStatus"  triggerSticks="true" triggerAttributes="fieldStatus:20-sown-1-1" />

    triggerSticks = So that if the mission detected this state, it won't forget it. Even if the same field is plowed afterwards for another trigger
    triggerAttributes="fieldStatus:20-sown-1-1"
        20 = fieldnumber (not farmLandid)
        sown = state. Other options: sown / plowed / cultivated
        1 = fruittype
        1 = growthstate
